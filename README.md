Epwviztoolkit is a comprehensive climate analysis dashboard designed for ease of use. Users can quickly perform climate analysis and generate detailed reports by downloading EPW weather files from a global map or uploading their own files. The toolkit analyzes various climate parameters, including dry/wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation (direct, diffuse, global), wind speed/direction, and precipitation. Users can explore these factors through an intuitive control panel and a variety of analytical plots, such as hourly/daily plots, rose diagrams, psychrometric charts (for PMV/PPD calculations), HDD/CDD calculations, temperature distribution plots, pair plots, and sun path diagrams. Ultimately, users can download a comprehensive report based on their selections or default values. While the toolkit is robust, it remains open to additional features based on user feedback and requests.
